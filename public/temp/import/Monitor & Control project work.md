# Description of Activity
Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. The key benefit of this process is that it allows stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, the steps taken, and budget, schedule, and scope forecasts.

# Input / Prerequisites
* Project management plan, Monitoring and controlling project work involves looking at all aspects of the project. Subsidiary plans within the project management plan form the basis for controlling the project. Subsidiary plans and baselines include,
	* Scope management plan
	* Requirements management plan
	* Schedule management plan
	* Cost management plan
	* Quality management plan
	* Process improvement plan
	* Human resource management plan
	* Communications management plan
	* Risk management plan
	* Procurement management plan
	* Stakeholder management plan
	* Scope baseline
	* Schedule baseline
	* Cost baseline 
* Schedule forecasts are derived from progress against the schedule baseline and computed time estimate to complete (ETC). This is typically expressed in terms of schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI). For projects not using earned value management, variances against the planned finish dates and forecasted finish dates are provided.
* Cost forecasts are derived from progress against the cost baseline and computed estimates to complete (ETC). This is typically expressed in terms of cost variance (CV) and cost performance index (CPI). An estimate at completion (EAC) can be compared to the budget at completion (BAC) to see if the project is still within tolerance ranges or if a change request is required. For projects not using earned value management, variances against the planned versus actual expenditures and forecasted final costs are provided.
* Validated changes that result from the Perform Integrated Change Control process require validation to ensure that the change was appropriately implemented. A validated change provides the necessary data to confirm that the change was appropriately executed.
* Work performance information is the performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed in context, and integrated based on relationships across areas. Thus work performance data has been transformed into work performance information. Data in itself cannot be used in the decision-making process as it has only out-of-context meaning. Work performance information, however, is correlated and contextualized, and provides a sound foundation for project decisions.
* Enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include, but are not limited to:
	* Governmental or industry standards (e.g., regulatory agency regulations, codes of conduct, product
standards, quality standards, and workmanship standards),
	* Organization work authorization systems,
	* Stakeholder risk tolerances, and
	* Project management information system (e.g., an automated tool suite, such as a scheduling software tool, a configuration management system, an information collection and distribution system, or web interfaces to other online automated systems).
* Organizational process assets that can influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include, but are not limited to: 
	* Organizational communication requirements;
	* Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting codes, and standard contract provisions);
	* Issue and defect management procedures defining issue and defect controls, issue and defect identification, and resolution and action item tracking;
	* Change control procedures, including those for scope, schedule, cost, and quality variances;
	* Risk control procedures including risk categories, probability definition and impact, and probability and impact matrix;
	* Process measurement database used to make available measurement data on processes and products; 
	* Lessons learned database.
