# Definition
Project Communications Management includes the processes that are required to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.

Project managers spend most of their time communicating with team members and other project stakeholders, whether they are internal (at all organizational levels) or external to the organization.

Effective communication creates a bridge between diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds, different levels of expertise, and different perspectives and interests, which impact or have an influence upon the project execution or outcome.

# Detailed description
The communication activities involved in these processes may often have many potential dimensions that need to be considered, including, but not limited to:
* Internal (within the project) and external (customer, vendors, other projects, organizations, the public);
* Formal (reports, minutes, briefings) and informal (emails, memos, ad-hoc discussions);
* Vertical (up and down the organization) and horizontal (with peers);
* Official (newsletters, annual report) and unofficial (off the record communications); and
* Written and oral, and verbal (voice inflections) and nonverbal (body language).

Most communication skills are common for both general management and project management, such as, but not limited to:
* Listening actively and effectively;
* Questioning and probing ideas and situations to ensure better understanding;
* Educating to increase team's knowledge so that they can be more effective;
* Fact-finding to identify or confirm information;
* Setting and managing expectations;
* Persuading a person, a team, or an organization to perform an action;
* Motivating to provide encouragement or reassurance;
* Coaching to improve performance and achieve desired results;
* Negotiating to achieve mutually acceptable agreements between parties;
* Resolving conflict to prevent disruptive impacts; and
* Summarizing, recapping, and identifying the next steps.
