# Description of Activity
Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities across all of the Project Management Process Groups to formally complete the project or phase. The key benefit of this process is that it provides lessons learned, the formal ending of project work, and the release of organization resources to pursue new endeavors.

# Input / Prerequisites
* Project management plan becomes the agreement between the project manager and project sponsor, defining what constitutes project completion.
* Accepted deliverables may include approved product specifications, delivery receipts, and work performance documents. Partial or interim deliverables may also be included for phased or canceled projects.
* Organizational process assets that can influence the Close Project or Phase process include, but are not limited to:
	* Project or phase closure guidelines or requirements (e.g., administrative procedures, project audits, project evaluations, and transition criteria); and
	* Historical information and lessons learned knowledge base (e.g., project records and documents, all project closure information and documentation, information about both the results of previous project selection decisions and previous project performance information, and information from risk management activities).

# Tools
* Expert judgment is applied when performing administrative closure activities. These experts ensure the project or phase closure is performed to the appropriate standards. Expertise is available from many sources
* Analytical techniques used in project closeout are:
	* Regression analysis, and
	* Trend analysis.
* Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. This may include project team members and other stakeholders, involved in or affected by the project. Types of meetings include, but are not limited to lessons learned, closeout, user group, and review meetings.

# Outputs
* Final product, service, or result transition : This output refers to the transition of the final product, service, or result that the project was authorized to produce (or in the case of phase closure, the intermediate product, service, or result of that phase).
* Organizational process assets updates
The organizational process assets that are updated as a result of the Close Project or Phase process include,
	* Project files: Documentation resulting from the project's activities, for example, project management plan; scope, cost, schedule, and project calendars; risk registers and other registers; change management documentation; planned risk response actions; and risk impact.
	* Project or phase closure documents consisting of formal documentation that indicates completion of the project or phase and the transfer of the completed project or phase deliverables to others, such as an operations group or to the next phase. During project closure, the project manager reviews prior phase documentation, customer acceptance documentation from the Validate Scope process (Section 5.4), and the contract (if applicable), to ensure that all project requirements are completed prior to finalizing the closure of the project. If the project was terminated prior to completion, the formal documentation indicates why the project was terminated and formalizes the procedures for the transfer of the finished and unfinished deliverables of the canceled project to others.
	* Historical information: Historical information and lessons learned information are transferred to the lessons learned knowledge base for use by future projects or phases. This can include information on issues and risks as well as techniques that worked well that can be applied to future projects.
