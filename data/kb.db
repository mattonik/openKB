{"kb_permalink":"project-procurement-management","kb_title":"Project Procurement Management","kb_body":"# Definition\r\nProject Procurement Management includes the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team. The organization can be either the buyer or seller of the products, services, or results of a project.\r\n\r\nProject Procurement Management includes the contract management and change control processes required to develop and administer contracts or purchase orders issued by authorized project team members.\r\n\r\nProject Procurement Management also includes controlling any contract issued by an outside organization (the buyer) that is acquiring deliverables from the project from the performing organization (the seller), and administering contractual obligations placed on the project team by the contract.\r\n# Detailed description\r\n The Project Procurement Management processes involve agreements, including contracts, which are legal documents between a buyer and a seller. A contract represents a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide something of value (e.g., specified products, services, or results) and obligates the buyer to provide monetary or other valuable compensation. An agreement can be simple or complex, and may reflect the simplicity or complexity of the deliverables or required effort.\r\n\r\nA procurement contract includes terms and conditions, and may incorporate other items that the buyer specifies as to what the seller is to perform or provide. It is the project management team's responsibility to make certain that all procurements meet the specific needs of the project while adhering to organizational procurement policies. Depending upon the application area, a contract can also be called an agreement, an understanding, a subcontract, or a purchase order. Most organizations document policies and procedures specifically defining the procurement rules and specifying who has authority to sign and administer such agreements on behalf of the organization.\r\n\r\nAlthough all project documents may be subject to some form of review and approval, the legally binding nature of a contract or agreement usually means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process. In all cases, the primary focus of the review and approval process is to ensure that the contract language describes the products, services, or results that will satisfy the identified project need.\r\n\r\nThe project management team may seek support in early phases from specialists in contracting, purchasing, law, and technical disciplines. Such involvement can be mandated by an organization's policies.\r\n\r\nThe various activities involved in the Project Procurement Management processes form the life cycle of an agreement. By actively managing the agreement life cycle and carefully wording the terms and conditions of a procurement, some identifiable project risks may be shared or transferred to a seller. Entering into an agreement\r\nfor products or services is one method of allocating the responsibility for managing or sharing potential risks.\r\n\r\nA complex project may involve managing multiple contracts or subcontracts simultaneously or in sequence. In such cases, each contract life cycle may end during any phase of the project life cycle. Project Procurement Management is discussed within the perspective of the buyer-seller relationship. The buyer-seller relationship may exist at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.\r\n\r\nDepending on the application area, the seller may be identified as a contractor, subcontractor, vendor, service provider, or supplier. Depending on the buyer's position in the project acquisition cycle, the buyer may be called a client, customer, prime contractor, contractor, acquiring organization, service requestor, or purchaser. The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle first as a bidder, then as the selected source, and then as the contracted supplier or vendor.\r\n\r\nThe seller will typically manage the work as a project if the acquisition is not just for shelf material, goods, or common products. In such cases:\r\n* The buyer becomes the customer, and is thus a key project stakeholder for the seller.\r\n* The seller's project management team is concerned with all the processes of project management, not only with those of this Knowledge Area.\r\n* Terms and conditions of the contract become key inputs to many of the seller's management processes.\r\n\r\nThe contract can actually contain the inputs (e.g., major deliverables, key milestones, cost objectives), or it can limit the project team's options (e.g., buyer approval of staffing decisions is often required on design projects).\r\n\r\nIn this section, it is assumed that the buyer of an item for the project is assigned to the project team and that the seller is organizationally external to the project team. It is also assumed that a formal contractual relationship will be developed and exists between the buyer and the seller. However, most of the discussion in this section is equally applicable to non-contractual work entered into with other units of the project team's organization.","kb_published":"true","kb_keywords":"","kb_published_date":{"$$date":1497859489512},"kb_last_updated":{"$$date":1497859489512},"kb_last_update_user":"Martin - mattonik@gmail.com","kb_author":"Martin","kb_author_email":"mattonik@gmail.com","kb_document":"noFile","kb_project_size":["0 - 25 MA","25 - 50 MA","50 - 100 MA"],"kb_methodology":["Waterfall (Classic)","Agile (SCRUM)"],"kb_phase":["Prestudy","Analysis & Design","Build","Test","Rollout","Decommissioning"],"kb_type":"article","_id":"ogiRyTB1cL2UgXAR"}
{"kb_permalink":"risk-management","kb_title":"Risk Management","kb_body":"## Definition\r\nProject Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management are to increase the likelihood and impact of positive events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events in the project.\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\nProject risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \r\n\r\nA risk may have one or more causes and, if it occurs, it may have one or more impacts.\r\n\r\nA cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, constraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nFor example, causes could include the requirement of an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the project. The risk is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of an opportunity, additional development personnel may become available who can participate in design, and they can be assigned to the project. If either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, scope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. \r\n\r\nRisk conditions may include aspects of the project's or organization's environment that contribute to project risk, such as immature project management practices, lack of integrated management systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on external participants who are outside the project's direct control.\r\n\r\nProject risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. Known risks are those that have been identfied and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. Known risks that cannot be managed proactively, should be assigned a contingency reserve. Unknown risks cannot be managed proactively and therefore may be assigned a management reserve. A negative project risk that has occurred is considered an issue.\r\n\r\nIndividual project risks are different from overall project risk. Overall project risk represents the effect of\r\nuncertainty on the project as a whole. It is more than the sum of the individual risks within a project, since it includes all sources of project uncertainty. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.\r\n\r\nOrganizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. Organizations and stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their risk attitude. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified into three themes:\r\n\r\n* Risk appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward. \r\n* Risk tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will\r\nwithstand.\r\n* Risk threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a stakeholder may have a specific interest. Below that risk threshold, the organization will accept the risk.\r\n\r\nAbove that risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.\r\nFor example, an organization's risk attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for risk levels that are unacceptable, or its risk tolerance at which point the organization may select a different risk response. \r\n\r\nPositive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. The project may be accepted if the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. Positive risks that offer opportunities within the limits of risk tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced value. For example, adopting an aggressive resource optimization technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a reward for using fewer resources.\r\n\r\nIndividuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. These risk attitudes are driven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. A consistent approach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should be open and honest. Risk responses reflect an organization's perceived balance between risk taking and risk avoidance.\r\n\r\nTo be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently throughout the project. A conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and pursue effective risk management during the life of the project.

This can include information on issues and risks as well as techniques that worked well that can be applied to future projects.\r\n\r\n## Involved roles","kb_published":"true","kb_keywords":"","kb_published_date":{"$$date":1497859292189},"kb_last_updated":{"$$date":1497859292189},"kb_last_update_user":"Martin - mattonik@gmail.com","kb_author":"Martin","kb_author_email":"mattonik@gmail.com","kb_document":"noFile","kb_project_size":["0 - 25 MA","25 - 50 MA","50 - 100 MA"],"kb_methodology":"Agile (SCRUM)","kb_phase":"Rollout","kb_type":"article","_id":"7VbIfurXfU1s56LJ","kb_viewcount":0}
